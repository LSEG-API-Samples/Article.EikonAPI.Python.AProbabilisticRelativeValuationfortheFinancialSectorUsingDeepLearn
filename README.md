This paper studies the implementation of deep learning to predict probability distributions. These describe the daily returns of stocks of the companies in the financial sector, listed in the S&amp;P500, using the data obtained from the Refinitiv Eikon API from 2002 to 2020. In addition, it proposes an approach to obtain a relative probabilistic value defined as the predicted mean divided by the predicted standard deviation of the returns of a stock.  Using six variables, obtained from the financial statements of the companies, as input to predict the parameters of four chosen distributions (normal, JohnsonSU, a mixture of three normal distributions, a mixture of two Johnson distributions), the results obtained range from 7 to 518 BPS each year in the test set.  The proposed neural networks obtain lower losses in the test data (including the period of the Covid-19 of 2020) than in the training data, even when they have more than 1400 trainable parameters without regularization nor dropout layers. Although it requires further study, the prediction of a probability distribution of returns allows for more informed decisions, showing an alternative use of deep learning for predicting stock returns.
